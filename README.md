Easier way to search the VMware vSAN HCL, online at https://hcl.captain-vsan.com and https://hcl.vsan.eu. Acts mostly as a parser for http://partnerweb.vmware.com/service/vsan/all.json

The official VMware version can be found on https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php?deviceCategory=vsanio
